            <p class="text-muted mt-3">
              <strong>BEFORE</strong><br />
              I'd been dating this guy who was not a great guy, and I'd been with him for about five years and I could
              not let go of him. I couldn't. I knew he was wrong for me. I knew I didn't actually want to be with him,
              but I couldn't not be with him. It was like out of my control.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted mt-3">
              <strong>AFTER</strong><br />
              So I was actually able to realize, No, I don't want to be with this guy and I can stop being with him. And
              I was able to put an end to that and move on with my life and opened the door to actually having a great
              relationship with my husband. It was a big part of me having three wonderful births. My kids are amazing.
              Of course, every mom says that, but they really, truly are. And everything I read in that book is part of
              what I do.

              <strong>BEFORE</strong><br />
              There was an injury, you know, when I was a kid, cut my knee open. It wasn't the knee that was painful.
              The painful part was the embarrassment, because the girl that I had a crush on was there and saw me being
              tended to. It was that feeling of helpless. That actually is what stuck with me. The reactive mind was
              just connecting it. Here's a girl. Here's a moment of you being weak. You have to be stronger. You have to
              do this. You have to build walls. You have to be a man. You have to be. So, we get to the root of it.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted mt-3">
              <strong>AFTER</strong><br />
              Boom! All that, that connection just releases. It's gone. I came out of there calm. I was just me. I said,
              Hey, everyone, I'm just me.

              Had several losses. My mom died of cancer. My dad committed suicide. And then I lost a son. I lost a baby.
              I mean, I was constantly crying. I mean, a commercial would come on and I would cry. I would see something

              <strong>BEFORE:</strong> I mean, I was doing really well in many areas of my life, except in
              relationships. And I would pick what would be probably the worst person in the world to do a relationship
              with. And then after being with them for a period of time, I would get a lot of evidence that this is the
              wrong person for me to be with, but I just couldn't end it. I thought for sure I was going to be a
              bachelor. One of those guys the rest of my life.

              <strong>AFTER:</strong> And ever since then and it was like one session, one like, and it was like 30
              minutes and it was like that big of a change. Because it was right at the core of what I really wanted to
              have in life, a loving, beautiful relationship. And that got fixed was one, one moment in time and it was
              gone. And it was like, Man, I got my attention.

              <strong>BEFORE:</strong> I had an issue with anxiety and depression since I was about ten years old, and
              it was there until I was about forty-five. So, it was a very long decades of anxiety and depression. And
              you just never knew when, like the anxiety was going to turn on and you were going to be have your car
              pulled over having a panic attack.

              <strong>AFTER:</strong> And now the anxiety and depression that were so gut wrenchingly difficult at times
              in my life is just completely gone.

              <strong>BEFORE:</strong> After an injury I sustained when I was about 12 years old. It sort of put a
              damper on the way that I approach life. There was sort of this longing to return to what I had had before
              in terms of my ability to communicate more freely. And I had lost that. And it was this thing that I
              carried with me for literally decades. I didn't realize how much of my life force, my negative emotions,
              had been trapped.

            <p class="text-muted">
              <strong>AFTER:</strong> It was a burst of joy, really tears of happiness that I regained. This portion of
              my life—I was a changed person.

              like, I was just feeling this internal glow, this is magic. Like, this is what I've wanted my whole life.
              I was in my car and I was like, Oh my God, it's the first time I’ve been happy for no reason. In, like my
              entire life. I cannot believe this was possible.

              Absolutely life changing! <br>
              My personal problem was that I had trouble speaking to people. I was afraid. There was no reason for it,
              it was completely irrational. But it was a huge problem for me in business deals, speaking with
              professors, giving presentations, and just generally being social. This not only was able to tell me why I
              had this problem and where it came from, but also HOW TO FIX IT. That's what really impressed me the most
              - it actually will fix the things that give you trouble in life, not just talk about them or give you some
              vague idea of what needs to be done.

              and the return of memory that this has handed me is impossible to describe. That said, this isn't about me
              it's about you and helping you get rid of influences that make life less fun. This has helped me in life,
              marriage, work, raising kids, and with family. I recommend it highly to anyone that wants to truly
              understand their mind and how it really works.

              ...actually handled my depression <br>
              I had severe depression after having my baby. Nothing seemed to help and I didn't want to be on pills for
              the rest of my life. Then I found this that's based on modern science. It made so much sense, and finally
              I felt like my questions were answered and I knew how and why I was feeling that way. I followed the
              instructions and I started getting better right away. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't want
              to take pills to handle their depression.

              This took me on a very unexpected trip. This one actually gives a practical explanation and remedy for the

              A fascinating, about the mind (and much more) <br>
              This is built around the idea that something positive can be done to not only address things I didn't
              understand or like about myself but also how to move forward no matter how crazy things get out there. I
              also really appreciated the understanding it gave me about other people. One thing I learned over the last
              few years is how important it is to take charge of my own life and my own health, physical and mental.
              This gave me a deep understanding and tools I can use pretty much every day.

              This was different. It just totally makes sense. It's very simple and I like that the science involved is
